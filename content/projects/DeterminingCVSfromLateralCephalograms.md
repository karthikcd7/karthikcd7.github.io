Developed a deep learning model to automatically classify [lateral cephalogram](https://www.dentalprotection.org/uk/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-lateral-cephalometric-radiographs) x-ray images into [CVS stages](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1073874605000216#:~:text=The%20new%20clinically%20improved%20CVM,occurs%20between%20CS3%20and%20CS4)  to assist in orthodontic diagnosis and growth prediction.
